# Workout Randomizer

Workouts can get pretty boring and your body can get used to it. 
If you're training for a Spartan race, then it's key to remain consistent with working out but also you need to be prepared for anything. Because I don't feel comfortable planning out a workout, I'm going to have Python plan it out for me!


This python script will:

- give me a random assortment of 2-3 workouts based on how many I ask for
- will not duplicate a workout in the same day
